An [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)-based GUI git client

[More info in this Medium article](https://medium.com/@PitaJ/making-wengit-341528bebc72)

#### Underlying principles
+ Simplicity in design and function
+ Don't forfeit features for design
+ Don't hide features from power users
+ Implement every feature of `git`
+ Use modules for host-specific features (like Github, Bitbucket)
